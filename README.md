Fault Diagnosis Engine

This Fault Diagnostic Engine implements agent-based fault diagnostics. It creates agents, hosted and supported within the GORITE Multi-Agent System framework. Refer to the documentation in the Fault Diagnosis System Software Architecture Document for a deeper explanation of how the  agents are constructed.
 
This version is a port of the original multiAgentSystem_03 prototype. It implements hard-coded fault-finding tasks using a single agent. It incorporates the libraries that allow the the agents to interact with the target Function Block Application that is being monitored or diagnosed.
